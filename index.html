  <h1>Hillary vs Trump debate</h1>
  <p>
    This is a recent hot topic that has been covered in SNL numerously. The SNL imitation is not only entertaining, but also demonstrated how political affairs has becoming a frequent topic to be portrayed in comedy settings. Furthermore, some of these comedic portrayal can sometimes produce such national impacts and influence the way we perceive these political figures like how broadcast news do. This brings up the question..

  <h1>Where it all begins..</h1>
  <p>
    Ever since the creation of computers in the 1950s, new technologies emerged and changed the way information were distributed (this period of time is termed as the age of new media). As information becoming gradually accessible, sharing and spreading information are also encouraged to such a level that same issues begin to be portrayed in different lights. Especially comedy shows, whose goals are to attract audiences and improve viewer ratings, they begin to overlap with broadcast news in terms of contents.

  <p>When Lewinsky was found to be guilty of having an affair with President Clinton, the entire nation was shaken. Above, on the left is the news coverage of Clinton's impeachment trial, on the right is the footage of Daily Show's  mockery. However,  keep in mind that Daily Show is not the only show that has covered the news. As <a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/14/">Carpini & Williams (2001)</a> described, the situation became</p>

  <h1>2. Becoming new source of political information for youth</h1>
</div>
<div class="content container">
  <p>They have begun to influence news by acting as a catalyst for encouraging viewing, especially among the young audiences. As we all know, adolescents play important roles and tend to be active in political participation to practice their authority. They tend to hold high interests in political affairs.</p>
  <p>According to <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2004/01/11/cable-and-internet-loom-large-in-fragmented-political-news-universe/">Pew Reseach Center (2004)</a>'s report, young audiences are in favor of late-night comedy programs as sources of election information news. Further suggested by
<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10584600802427013" >Fieldman & Young (2008)</a>, comedy shows such as The Daily Show has opened up the gate for adolescents to learn about political topics, which encourage them to watch broadcast news. </p>

  <p>Seen from the chart, over time, the rate of increase in attention to the campaign on television news will be greater for viewers of The Daily Show than those who do not watch late-night comedy.

  <h1>3. Challenging Journalists' exclusive roles as agenda setters</h1>
  <p>
    Agenda setting - If a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important (wiki)

  <p>In 2008, when Sarah Palin was nominated for vice president, her chance of being elected as vice president was destroyed when SNL performed a skit imitating her interview. This case study shows comedy depiction of political figures has become influential in real world political affairs. On the other hand, comedy portrayal indirectly provided new topics for broadcast news. This demonstrates journalists are losing their exclusive agenda-setting roles, and comedy shows begin to slowly take place and challenge the perspective of news.

  <h1>2012 Obama V Romney</h1>
  <p>The host Stephen Colbert took public's perspectives and expressed the society's deep inner-thought toward the election. While on the other hand, the news programs make it looks like everyone is happy with the result. By taking side with the public, Colbert Show portrayed a different kind of news coverage of the election result.</p>

  <h1>2014 Net neutrality</h1>
  <p>This shows how comedy political shows are becoming news by digesting government information and bringing up new issues. On one episode of Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver criticizes the government FCC for its attempt to reduce people's accessibility to all sorts of contents on the internet. After Oliver brought up the issue, the netizens were stirred and went on FCC's site to protest, and eventually crashed the site. </p>
